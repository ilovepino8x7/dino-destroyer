# Dino Destroyer
My game for the Summer of Making - Dino Destroyer is a game where you, Denny, are trying to protect the planet from the evil alien dinosaurs, and trying to last the longest and get the most points.


## What is in the game
  Hordes of enemy Dinos trying to beat you, and break your brand new Dishwasher

## How to play:
  Use A & D to move left and right and Space to jump. Land on the Dinos' heads to beat them, but make sure they don't touch you first or you will hear them cackle and you will lose a point. Press 'R' to reset if you get stuck, and remember, watch out for the Red Dino of DOOOOM, which moves at high speed and takes away more points than the regular green variety, but also gifts much more if you successfully beat it.
